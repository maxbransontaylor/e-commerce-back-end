# E-Commerce Back-End

## Description

This application is a demo back end for an E-commerce website that uses MySQL to create and store data for product categories, products, and product tags. The category, product, and tag models each respond to API routes that execute CRUD methods on the associated tables. The endpoints are /api/categories, /api/products, and /api/tags, respectively. The API was designed to meet RESTful criterea wherever possible.
